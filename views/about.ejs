        <p>
          Death literacy is the practical know-how needed to plan for, care for,
          and respond to dying, death, and bereavement. It includes legal
          understanding, emotional preparedness, community support, and the
          grace to have open conversations about these issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our platform provides research-backed quizzes, personalized feedback,
          and curated resources to improve your literacy in all areas of
          end-of-life planning and care.
